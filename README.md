# SEARCH-PRIME: The easy way to search Amazon

This is the code repository for a my web app called SEARCH-PRIME.<br/>
[Search-Prime](https://prime.staticvoidmain.app/)

Filter search results in Amazon. Show only Prime, sold by Amazon, four stars and up! Find and show only the items you want to see.

This web app is written in Angular and TypeScript. It uses the Angular Material Library. It uses LESS as CSS preprocessor because I personally like LESS.
